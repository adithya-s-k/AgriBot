## Problem Statement
According to a study in 2018, the agricultural sector employed about 50% of the workforce yet only contributed to 17-18% of Indiaâ€™s overall GDP. Soil testing can be a tedious task, inaccurate manual analysis could lead to loss of crops and low productivity infertility of soil.

## Solution
To determine the soil characteristics we require the use of a robot crane with sensors such as NPK, temperature, humidity, tilt and moisture. The measured data is run through machine learning model and a report is produced which determines the best crop to grow in the given soil
