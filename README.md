## Problem Statement

- Lack of Efficient and Automated Solutions for Crop Recommendation and Plant Growth Optimization
- According to a study in 2018, the agricultural sector employed about 50% of the workforce yet only contributed to 17-18% of Indiaâ€™s overall GDP. Soil testing can be a tedious task, inaccurate manual analysis could lead to loss of crops and low productivity infertility of soil.

## Solution

- The Agriculture Bot is an innovative device designed to optimize plant growth and recommend suitable crops for a particular field. It uses sensors and machine learning algorithms to collect data on the physical conditions of the soil, temperature, humidity, and other parameters to determine the best suitable crop for the field.

- To determine the soil characteristics we require the use of a robot crane with sensors such as NPK, temperature, humidity, tilt and moisture. The measured data is run through machine learning model and a report is produced which determines the best crop to grow in the given soil
